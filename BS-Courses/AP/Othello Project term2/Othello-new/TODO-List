Our To-do list:



not to forget:
1- Change int to char for optimization.
2- find a way to store MOVEs for undoing(change the MOVE struct).
3- find the maximum numbers of moves.
4- How to handle a tie.(important)
5- We calculate opponent's moves in all steps while we can calculate them only in the last step.
6- MakeMove list doesn't need to generate a list in the evaluation function.
