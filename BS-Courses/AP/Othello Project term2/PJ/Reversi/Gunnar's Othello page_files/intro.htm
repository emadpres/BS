<h2 align="center">Zebra</h2>

<hr>

<p>

Being a computer freak, I decided to start working seriously
on an Othello playing program in June 1997.
I decided to give the program the name "Zebra".
I already had created such a program two years earlier,
but its weak play made it necessary to discard almost all the old code.
The program has since then improved a lot, and the only hopes
I have of winning against it now is that I will discover some obscure
search bug in the code... so when I do win against it, I know that
there is some debugging to be done.
Except for terribly buggy versions, I have <b>never</b> beaten Zebra.
The closest I have come is a drawn position with 21 empty...
which I (of course) failed to convert and lost 29-35 instead... bummer.
Zebra is now strong enough that it is extremely unlikely that I get
this close again; not that this is an overly strong statement - I get
crushed by all strong human players as well...

A Windows version of Zebra can be downloaded from the
<a href="http://www.radagast.se/othello/download.html" target="display">download page</a>.
This is a joint project with Lars Ivansson who has created the GUI.

</p><p>

The Zebra source code is released under the GPL:

</p><h3>Short facts</h3>

<ul>

<li>
Opening book based on games between top players and
self-play games, currently more than 500'000 positions.
Learns from each game it plays.
</li>

<li>
Uses the search algorithms <i>NegaScout</i> and
<i>Multi Prob-Cut</i>.
A hash table of 2'000'000 entries (or more) is used during
tournaments.
Hash table information, move statistics and shallow searches are used
for move ordering.
</li>

<li>
Evaluates positions using a pattern-based evaluation scheme.
Each configuration of every
<ul>
<li>
row
</li>

<li>
column
</li>

<li>
diagonal of length 4-8
</li>
<li>
edge + adjacent X-squares
</li>

<li>
3x3-corner
</li>

<li>
5x2-corner
</li>
</ul>
has a value associated with it for each of 12 game stages.
Linear interpolation is used between game stages.
The pattern values are added together with a parity measure and
estimates the final disk difference.
To tune the values for the patterns (about 1'000'000 different when
taking symmetries into account),
a large over-determined linear system of equations was solved
approximately using Fletcher-Reeves' conjugate gradient method.
</li>

<li>
Searches 18-27 moves in the midgame and 24-31 moves in the endgame
in a normal game (2x15 minutes).
</li>

<li>
Usually runs on a Thunderbird / 1.33GHz / 1024MB under Windows 2000.
On this hardware, Zebra typically searches 1'300'000-1'500'000 positions/second
in the midgame and 4'000'000-7'000'000 positions/second in the endgame.
</li>

<li>
Consists of about 50'000 lines of C code and 1'000 lines of x86 assembly code
(which can be replaced by equivalent C code on other platforms).
Usually compiled with
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">GCC</a>
.
</li>

</ul>

</p><h3>Things to work on</h3>

<menu>

<li>
Rare board configurations in some cases are not evaluated
correctly due to lack of example positions in the game
database which was used for creating Zebra's knowledge.
This problem can in part be solved by developing an
interpolation scheme to fill the knowledge gaps,
Mark Brockington solved this problem in his program Keyano
by using a neural net.
