<h2> LOGISTELLO </h2>

is one of today's strongest Othello programs. Besides the powerful
hardware on which it is running and the efficient implementation of
standard game-tree searching techniques, the program's considerable
playing strength is mainly due to several new approaches for the
construction of evaluation features, their combination, selective
search, and learning from previous games which <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Emburo/index.html">I</a> have investigated in my <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Emburo/publications.html">Ph.D. thesis</a> and considerably improved
while working at NECI.

</a> (i.e. (self-)played games) for studying openings, training
evaluation parameters, or just improving your bot's book. Games are
stored as ASCII move sequences annotated with the final game result in
black's view. All ~37K lines are at least 24-ply WLD correct. The file
is gzip'ed. Click <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Emburo/logbook.wtb.gz">here</a> if you prefer the 
WTHOR format.

Logistello's <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Emburo/logistello.tar.gz">source code</a> is now available. 
Last update: November/4/2002: Stephane Nicolet found a bug in the MPC code - fixed.

README file:
<br><br>
This is the Logistello source directory which is licensed under the
GPL. I worked on it from 1992 till 1998. As a result, it's not a
pretty sight: a zillion tools for handling different game file
formats, computing statistics, solving logistic and linear regression
systems, book learning, running tournaments etc. Many of them are now
obsolete. Some of the code is hard to read - some comments and
variable names are even in German (Brett=board,Zug=move,Wert=value).
I hardly can tell which file is actually used anymore. The makefiles
can be a starting point for exploring the source code. The current
Logistello version is generated by "make ../oplayl". I have not
included the training data, nor the opening book, nor the pattern
and Multi-ProbCut tables. Although the program compiles, it cannot be
used to play Othello out of the box. All the software for creating
missing tables is included, however. What's missing is the 17 million
training positions - which are not that hard to generate nowadays.
<p>
The purpose of this release is to present the implementation details
of a strong game-playing program. My hope is that it is useful for
designing coming generations of even stronger programs.

<h2> Development History</h2>
<ul> 
<li> 1991: first experiments with statistical feature combination
</li><li> 1992: searching for significant and fast evaluation features
</li><li> 1993: here they are: estimated pattern tables, line approximation of 
           mobility and potential mobility; features are combined using logistic 
          regression; L wins its first tournament ("Paderborn I") achieving
          16k nodes/sec in middle-game on a SPARC-10/M20.
</li><li> 1994: found an effective selective search approach: ProbCut; 
           learning opening book
</li><li> 1995: 10-disc patterns; new book algo. which maximizes out-of-book evaluation
</li><li> 1996: multi-ProbCut; hashtable improvement
</li><li> 1997: new evaluation function based on plain linear regression; search speed
           is now 280K nodes/sec in middle-game on a DEC Alpha/500.
</li></ul>

<h2> Recent Improvements</h2>

<ul>

<li> Mar 1995: 10-disc patterns
</li><li> May 1995: new best-first style endgame search for solving close positions faster
</li><li> Jul 1995: book-algorithm is now playing for maximal score when leaving the book
</li><li> May 1996: book-randomization
</li><li> Oct 1996: multi-ProbCut
</li><li> Nov 1996: major table estimation bug fixed, new version beats old 57% of the time
</li><li> Dec 1996: hash-table improvement saves 15-40% searchtime 
</li><li> Mar 1997: a new table estimation technique increases the playing strength considerably
</li><li> Apr 1997: the entire book has been re-computed using the new evaluation function
</li><li> May 1997: speed boost on a DEC Alpha/500: in middle-game 280k nodes/sec, in endgame 1000k nodes/sec
</li><li> July 1997: increasing the number of training examples by means of book correction and 
generating rare positions to fill table gaps improves the evaluation function
</li></ul>
