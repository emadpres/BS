<H1>A few words about othello, chess and games programming</H1>You will find in 
this page lot of informations I have gathered through the years regarding games 
programming, especially othello and chess. 
<H2>About OTAGE, my othello program...</H2><I>To play with OTAGE, follow <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/OTAGE">this </A>link </I>
<P>Games programming has always been a hobby of mine. I learned playing chess 
quite young, was a rated player in my teenage years, and learned to play Othello 
/ Reversi when I was 14. 
<P>I wrote my first computer game program on a TRS-80 (a Z-80 based computer 
available in 1978) in assembly language, when I was a teenager. It was an 
othello program which was quite weak, but could defeat me from time to time. It 
used a classical alpha-beta algorithm, something I had read about in articles 
writen by the former chess master David Levy in the French Magazine 
"L'ordinateur individuel". The evaluation function was very bad at that time... 
<P>After some years dedicated to mathematics, I started again in 1984, in 
Fortran and on a mainframe system (a VAX-8600) at the Ecole Polytechnique. The 
evaluation function has improved, and the program was already much better. In 
1987, I wrote a C/assembly 68000 version which ran on an amiga computer and on 
Sun 68020 based Workstations. The evaluation function was still static (and 
completely hand-made). It was tested by a quite good french player (ranked 10) 
and proved to be a good opponent. 
<P>After completing my PhD, I didn't have much time to work on games 
programming. However, a few years later, I returned to the field. I was working 
in global optimization, and genetic algorithms, and we had problems to devise 
probabilistic fitness functions. So I decided to dig out my old othello program 
and to try a few things for optimizing its evaluation function. The following <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=articles&amp;file=ea95.txt">article 
</A>describes how we tried to tackle the problem. I am not that sure that this 
technic is really fitted for improving evaluation function, but we had some 
interesting successes in other fields, such as plane conflict resolution (look 
<A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=articles&amp;file=birds2.txt">here 
</A>), or turbo code optimization for satellite digital transmissions (look <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=articles&amp;file=cec99.txt">here 
</A>)! 
<P>The article above interested different people and I had some interesting 
remarks by my friend JC Weill about it, regarding the evaluation function and 
its poor structure (JCW wrote many computer games programs, and his chess 
program won, I think, a microcomputer championship). As I hadn't time to improve 
the function by hand, I tried a different technic, a complete start from nothing 
with only statistic evaluation of the geometrical structure of the board. That 
was how the <B>OTAGE </B>program was born. 
<P>The OTAGE evaluation function is extremely simple. There are two basic terms: 
one comes from the liberties values (see article above) and the other comes from 
a statistical evaluation of 8 areas of the board: the 4 edges and the 4 3x3 
corners. In the beginning, the program doesn't know anything about the value of 
the different configurations. It plays a lot of games against itself, and 
statistically records the results in a very simple way. Then, it tries to 
reproduce winning configurations and to escape losing ones. 
<P>OTAGE was tested on the Internet Othello Server (IOS) and ranked as high as 
5. It was however no match for the best programs (Logistello, by Michael Buro, 
Keyano from J. Schaeffer's team, Hannibal, etc). It definitely lacks an opening 
book (M. Buro approach to opening books in Othello is extremely interesting, but 
I never had the time to implement it). 
<P>OTAGE development has stopped for many reasons, mainly because I haven't the 
time to work on it. It might get revived if one of my students get a grant on 
this subject, but that doesn't seem very probable. 
<P>I don't provide the source code of the program. I still consider OTAGE as 
unfinished, with lot of tweaks and workarounds, and don't want to distribute 
such a mess... 
<P>If you want to learn more about Othello programming, visit Michael Buro's <A 
href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~mburo/">homepage</A>. Logistello (his program) 
is definitely the reference. 
<H2>A chinese checkers program</H2>A few months ago, some friends decided to 
launch a chinese checkers computer tournament. Everyone was to write a program 
and to enter it. I decided to take the opportunity to try to write quickly 
something in Object Caml, which is now the language I am using, just to prove 
that OCAML was certainly the fastest way to have something running, and that the 
program would be quite competitive anyway. In fact, it turned out that I was the 
only one to complete the program... You lazy guys... The source code is <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/cc4.ml">here </A>in OCAML. Have fun 
with it... Honestly, the program is not a too bad opponent, and there are some 
ideas about move generations in chinese checkers that I would have loved to 
discuss with other CC programmers. You need <A 
href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml">OCAML </A>to compile the program. 
<H2>An Awele program</H2>Some of my students decided to write an Awele program 
in 2004. So I wrote mine... You can play online with it with this <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/AWELE">link </A>. 
<H2>Abalone </H2>Abalone is a very addictive game, and a project that my 
students had to complete last year. As I always write the program before, <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/aba.tgz">this </A>is the source code 
of an Abalone program in tgz format. There again, you need OCAML to compile it. 
You can play online with it by following this <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/ABALONE">link </A>. 
<H2>Quarto </H2>Quarto is a very interesting game to program as the evaluation 
function may be not symmetrical. You can play quarto online with my program by 
following this <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/QUARTO">link </A>. 
<H2>About checkers</H2>There are two other kind of checkers, american checkers 
(played on a 8x8 board) and international checkers (played on a 10x10 board). 
Rules are slightly different. If you want to learn everything about checkers, 
just go to J. Schaeffer's <A 
href="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~jonathan">homepage</A>. His program Chinook is 
currently unbeatable at 8x8 checkers... 
<P>I am currently writing an 10x10 checkers program (in OCAML again). I will 
probably put it on the net as soon as it is completed... 
<H2>And chess ?</H2>Chess and chess programming was my main interest. I was a 
rated player when I was younger and my parents bought me one of the first 
computer chess board, the Fidelity Electronics Chess Challenger. The program was 
written by the Spracklen, who later wrote the Sargon programs for 
microcomputers. I bought the Sargon III program for the apple II, and it was 
certainly a wonderful opponent at this time (early 80). I still used it on the 
Amiga. When I had my first PC, I bought the mychess program by Marty Hirsch. 
Now, I own the <A href="http://www.chessmaster.com/">Chessmaster 7000</A>, 
mainly for my kids. They learned to play with it and it has many pleasant 
features for children, such as having opponents with different personalities. 
<P>For playing myself, or for games analysis, I use the Rebel Decade 3.0 
program. It is the free version of the excellent Rebel program by Ed Schroder. 
Have a look at its <A href="http://www.rebel.nl/">homepage</A>. Rebel is 
definitely not what you want for fancy interfaces, but its way of playing is 
extremely interesting. For analysis, it is easy to use and the databases 
functions are really useful. Ed Shroder left his company a few years ago. His 
homepage is now <A href="http://members.home.nl/matador/index.htm">here </A>. 
You can download his new version of Rebel (which is now free), called ProDeo <A 
href="http://members.home.nl/matador/prodeo.htm">here </A>. 
<P>It took me a long time to decide to write a chess program. Then in 2005, some 
of my students challenged me to write a chess program in full ADA based on the 
bitboard technique. I like challenges, so I wrote LOVELACE. The program is very 
bad (around 1800 ELO I would say), endgames are terrible, the evaluation 
function is poor, and no "good" heuristics are implemented, but that was the 
best I could do in one month and working only part time on it. It implements 
part of the xboard protocol and can be used as an xboard engine. The code is 
available <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/chess.tgz">here </A>. It 
is mainly of interest for ADA students, or game programming students; ADA is 
still much more readable than C... I will design a JAVA interface for playing 
online when I have some time available. 
<P>For people interested, there is a much better souce code available for free: 
<A href="ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/pub/hyatt">crafty</A>. Have a look at its author 
<A href="http://www.cis.uab.edu/info/faculty/hyatt/hyatt.html">homepage </A>. 
<P>Recently the fruit program was also released in the public domain. It is 
extremely strong, even stronger than some commercial engines. The binaries and 
sources are available <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/fruit_21.zip">here </A>for windows 
and <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/fruit_21_linux.zip">here 
</A>for linux. 
<H2>General informations about games programming algorithms</H2>I wrote a book 
about computer science and artificial intelligence <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=books&amp;file=iaetit.txt">"Intelligence 
Artificelle et Informatique Théorique"</A> which included a large chapter about 
games programming. It is, I think, a quite concise and up-to-date description of 
modern algorithms in games programming, including SSS*, Nega-C*, MTD(f), Iter 
alpha-beta, hash and transposition tables, etc... There are also discussions 
regarding chess programming and classical problems in that area. The chapter is 
available in <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/book.ps">postscript 
</A>and <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/book.pdf">pdf</A>, but it 
is in french... Sorry for english only readers... 
<P>However, there are also here a few articles written in english about games 
programming on this site. Two extremely interesting articles <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/aij-final.ps">here </A>and 
<A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/bfmms.ps">here </A>by 
Aske Plaat, Jonathan Schaeffer and others comparing alpha-beta, SSS* and MTD(f). 
There is also Aske Plaat <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/thesis.ps">PhD </A>thesis, 
which is an excellent introduction to games algorithms. There is also a good 
presentation of <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/mtdf.html">MTD(f) </A>in 
HTML format. All of this comes from <A 
href="http://home.tiscali.nl/askeplaat">Aske Plaat</A> excellent web site. 
<P>An <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/negac.ps">article 
</A>by Jean-Christophe Weill about the NegaC* algorithm along with the <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/ALGOS_JEU/phdJCW.ps">PhD </A>thesis 
of JC Weill, which is extremely interesting, regarding parallelism and chess 
programming. The PhD thesis is in french however. 
<H2>Philosophical discussions</H2>In my younger days, I was extremely interested 
in Artificial Intelligence (I had my <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=thesis&amp;file=thesejma.txt">PhD 
</A>in non-classical logic) and its philosophical implications. I think that 
most things related to chess, chess programming, or chess psychology are 
relevant to other human activities, and human activities modeling, and that's 
one of the reason of the major interest in that field. I wrote an <A 
href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/papers/notice.html?todo=abstract&amp;type=articles&amp;file=ictai96.txt">article 
</A>about the application to Air Traffic Control of such principles. It is more 
a funny thing than anything else, but you can have a look... 
<P>Chess playing has been one of the first topics studied by psychologists. The 
first studies were conducted by Binet around 1894. He considered blind playing 
and the masters' internal representation of the chessboard. In 1925, a sovietic 
team including Diakov, Petrovsky and Roudik conducted a survey during Moscow 
tournament, where Lasker, Tartacover, Reti, Torre and others were competing. 
Later, Miller in the US, de Groot in the Netherlands, and Nicolai Kroguious in 
the Soviet union, among the most famous, conducted similar works. Moreover, the 
original goal of Artificial Intelligence was to model human reasoning. Since 
chess playing is one of the most prestigious symbols of human intelligence, it 
is not surprising that some of the founding fathers of AI (Newell, Simon and 
Shaw, among others) very soon took active interest in chess playing (as soon as 
1957). NSS, one of the very first AI computer programs, was a chess program. 
Since then, chess remained one of the most, if not the most commonly studied 
topics in AI. Some tremendous failures occurred, but some significant successes 
were obtained during the last years. 
<P>One of my favorite quote on that subject is from Hans Berliner: <BR>"I 
consider the most important trend was that computers got considerably faster in 
these last 50 years. In this process, we found that many things for which we had 
at best anthropomorphic solutions, which in many cases failed to capture the 
real gist of a human's method, could be done by more brute-forcish methods that 
merely enumerated until a satisfactory solution was found. If this is heresy, so 
be it." <BR>After completing my PhD, I was completely convinced by the above 
point of view. Efficient programs do not rely on human knowledge. This doesn't 
mean that knowledge modeling is not interesting. It can be useful, for example, 
to have a chess program playing more "like a human being", just because it would 
be more fun. 
<P>This subject was the center of the debate in AI for years (until the late 
80). It is, for example, extremely interesting to search statistically the MIT 
AI lab bibliography database to see how many things were written on human 
knowledge modeling, and how the debate was hot in the 80's. Philosophers wrote 
articles about it (John Searle's "chinese room argument" was quite famous). 
Marvin Minsky was one of the most famous defender of the cognitive school of AI, 
and was one of the more harmful. There are lot of interesting books and you will 
find <A href="http://www.recherche.enac.fr/~alliot/philo.bib">here </A>a bibtex 
bibliography, which is quite messy, but contains lot of things. 
<P>Now the "cognitive" school of artifical intelligence is almost dead. 
Cognitive sciences have mainly returned to the field of neuro-sciences, and the 
war is over. However , discussions still arise from time to time about chess and 
AI. Just have a look at the rec.games.chess.computers newsgroup...
