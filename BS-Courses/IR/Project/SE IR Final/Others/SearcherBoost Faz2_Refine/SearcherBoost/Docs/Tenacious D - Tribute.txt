Tenacious D - Tribute


This is the greatest and best song in the world's. . . tribute.

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,...
we was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden,
there shined a shiny demon...
in the middle...
of the road.

And he said:
"Play the best song in the world,
or I'll eat your souls (whisper:Souls)."

Well me and Kyle,... we looked at each other,
and we each said...
"Okay."

And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,
The Best Song in the World,
it was The Best Song in the World.

Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two,
two and one make three,
It was destiny.

Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
and the grass doth grow oooh

Needless to say,
the beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his rubber tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us:
"(snort) BE you angels?"
And we said,
"Nay.
We are but men
Rock!!
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahn,
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!

This is not The Greatest Song in the World, No
This is just a tribute.
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World, No.
No!
This is a tribute, oh,
To The Greatest Song in the World,
All right!
It was The Greatest Song in the World,
All right!
And it was the best mother fuckin' song,
The Greatest Song in the world!

Allllllright!

And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
the song we sang on that fateful night it didn't actually sound
anything like this song!

This is just a tribute!
You gotta believe me!
And I wish you were there!
Just a matter of opinion.
Ah, fuck!
Good God, God lovin' ,
So surprised to find you can't stop me,now.
I'm on fire--
O hallelujah I'm found! Rich motherfucker compadre simultaniously:oooh/(Demonic)aaaaah!
All right!
