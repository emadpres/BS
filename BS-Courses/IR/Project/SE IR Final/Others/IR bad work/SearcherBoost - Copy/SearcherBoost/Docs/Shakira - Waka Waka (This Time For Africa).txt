Shakira - Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)



You’re a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
And back in the saddle
You’re on the front line
Everyone’s watching
You know it’s serious
We’re getting closer
This isn’t over

The pressure’s on; you feel it
But you got it all; believe it
When you fall get up oh oh
And if you fall get up eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Cause this is Africa
Tsamina mina eh eh
Waka waka eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your god; this is our motto
Your time to shine
Don’t wait in line
Y vamos por todo
People are raising their expectations
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitation

Today’s your day
I feel it
You paved the way
Believe it
If you get down
Get up oh oh
When you get down
Get up eh eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
Tsamina mina eh eh
Waka waka eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa aa
