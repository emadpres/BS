Younha - Houkiboshi(Comet) lyrics



yozora o miage hitori   houkiboshi o mita no
isshun de hajikete wa   kiete shimatta kedo
anata no koto omou to   mune ga itaku naru no
ima sugu aitai yo   dakedo sora wa tobenai kara

Looking up at the night sky alone, I saw a comet
Though it appeared and vanished in a second
When I think of you, my chest begins to hurt
I want to see you right now, but I can't fly through the sky

----------------------------------------------------------------

moshi atashi ga   houkiboshi ni nareta naraba
sora kakenuke   tonde iku, donna 
ashita ga kite mo   ko no omoi wa tsuyoi
dakara houkiboshi zutto   kowarenai yo

If perchance I could have become a comet
I would go flying through the sky
No matter what kind of tomorrow comes, this thought is strong
So my comet is unbreakable

----------------------------------------------------------------

ame ga futte iyada to   boyaiteita toki ni
anata ga itta koto   ima demo oboeteru
ame no ato no yozora wa   kirei ni hoshi ga deru
sore o kangaeru to   ame mo suki ni nareru yo ne to

As I was complaining about how hateful the rain was
Even now I still remember what you said
How, after the rain, the night sky is beautifully filled with stars
Thinking of that, I could even come to like the rain

----------------------------------------------------------------

moshi atashi ga   houkiboshi ni nareta naraba
afureru hikari furasu yo   itsumo
kanashii toki   yozora miru anata ga
egao ni naru youni   motto kagayakitai

If perchance I could have become a comet
I would always spill my overflowing light
As you look at the night sky when you're sad
I want to sparkle more so that you will smile

----------------------------------------------------------------

anata wa itsumo hitori   nanika to tatakatteru
soba ni iru koto shika   atashi ni wa dekinai kedo

You are always fighting something by yourself
Being by your side is all I can do

----------------------------------------------------------------

moshi atashi ga   houkiboshi ni nareta naraba
sora kakenuke tonde iku   kitto
kanarazu todoku   ko no isshun no hikari de
anata no IMA terashi sora o   megurou
atashi ga   houkiboshi ni nareta naraba
kitto soba ni ite ageru,   donna toki mo

If perchance I could have become a comet
I would go flying thorugh the sky, surely
I would definitely reach you, with this single moment of light
Lighting up your present and passing through the sky
If I could have become a comet
I would surely stay by your side, at any time
