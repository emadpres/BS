Hit'N'Hide - World of dreams

Here we are once again trapped in a fantasy.
You and I, we are here, this is an illusion.
Come with me, take my hand, travel into Dreamland.
Look at me, listen now, this is my conclusion.

Everyone, around the world,
Are you ready to live forever.

This is a world, a world of dreams,
Where we can be together, you and me forever,
This is a world, a world of dreams,
Tonight it's gonna be, can't you see.

Close your eyes, make a wish, and drift into Fairyland.
This is fun, see me now, this is a fantasy.
Look around, feel the wind, magic is in the air.
Is it true, what I see, dreaming of you and me.

Everyone, around the world,
Are you ready to live forever.

This is a world, a world of dreams,
Where we can be together, you and me forever,
This is a world, a world of dreams,
Tonight it's gonna be, can't you see.

Take me to this world of dreams,
Little Dreamchild in your hand,
I'm so sleepy, can't you see,
Take me into Fairyland.
